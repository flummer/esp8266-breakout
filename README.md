# ESP8266 Breakout Board

This is a simple breakout board for the ESP8266-F modules, designed to be easy to use with the [WLED Project](https://kno.wled.ge/) and also possible to solder without too much trouble using a regular soldering iron.

It's relatively bare bone and only have the minimum required, though 2 buttons are included to make it easier to reset and flash the controller. The buttons can be omitted and simply shorted when programming, as they are not needed for running WLED.

## Designed in KiCad v9

To open the project, you will need to install v9 or a recent nightly build, KiCad v8 or earlier won't open this design directly.
